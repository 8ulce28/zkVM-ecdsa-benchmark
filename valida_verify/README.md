# Valida Benchmarking Code

This directory contains the guest code (inside `valid_a_verify/guest`), the host code that might be used to keep track of the proof generation 
and verification time  (inside `valid_a_verify/host`), and an additional helper file (inside `measure`) that extracts the proof size. For installing 
Valida VM, please refer to the [official Valida tutorial](https://lita.gitbook.io/lita-documentation/quick-start/installation-and-system-requirements).
As written in the link, Valida currently does not natively support ARM64 architectures. Thus, in such architectures, one must use Docker to build and 
run valida in an x86_64 emulated environment. 

## Running the Code

To be able to build and run possible host codes in an ARM64 architecture, one needs to use Docker to create a compatible container that emulates the required architecture. Related to this fact, proof generation takes >18 minutes in the host code while it takes approximately 3.1 minutes if done using CLI commands, which is likely due to differences in Docker setup, filesystem overhead, or container configuration. That is, the host code runs in a custom Docker container with additional mounted volumes and dependencies, which may introduce overhead. In contrast, the CLI commands are executed inside validaâ€™s official minimal Docker shell, which is likely more optimized for performance. Therefore, CLI commands are used in this part of the benchmark. All the following commands are run inside `valid_a_verify/guest`.

To build the guest, first, we need to get inside the Valida shell, which can be done by running 
```
docker run --platform linux/arm64 --entrypoint=/bin/bash -it --rm -v $(realpath .):/src ghcr.io/lita-xyz/llvm-valida-releases/valida-build-container:v0.10.0-arm64
```
in ARM64 platforms and by running
```
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --entrypoint=/bin/bash -it --rm -v $(realpath .):/src ghcr.io/lita-xyz/llvm-valida-releases/valida-build-container:v0.10.0-amd64
```
in x86_64 platforms. Then, we build the guest using the command `cargo +valida build --release`. Then, to time the execution of the guest,
```
time valida run --fast ./target/valida-unknown-baremetal-gnu/release/guest log
```
; to time the proof generation,
```
time valida prove ./target/valida-unknown-baremetal-gnu/release/guest proof input
```
; and to time the verification of the proof,
```
time valida verify ./target/valida-unknown-baremetal-gnu/release/guest proof output
```
commands are used. Finally, to measure the proof byte, `measure` is run.
